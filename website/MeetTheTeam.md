# Meet the Team!

## Amit Kumar

## Isa de Luis

Isa is a Engineering with Computing student at Olin. Throughout the project she enjoyed working with the NegaMax Algorithm and optimizing it using techniques 
like bitboards. She spent the last half of the project focused only on the mechanical system, building and making modifications to it to ensure that the team
had a working final project by demo day. Additionally, she made sure that the team was reaching their goals by the end of each sprint and figuring
out what needed to be done in order to get a working machiene by demo day.

## Diana Garcia

Diana is thinking about majoring in electrical engineering at Olin, however she is currently testing the waters with all the different engineering majors that Olin has to offer. She is currently taking a mechanical engineering class called Transport Phenomena which focuses on the movement of fluids which she really enjoys. Through this project Diana has been able to improve her computing skills by developing the code that controls and integrates the electrical system that she also designed.
