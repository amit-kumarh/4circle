# Overview:

Welcome to our site!

For PIE we created a bot to play Connect 4 against a human player. To implement this we created a Negamax algorithm that would find the best move possible and send a command to the arduino, which would then move our mechanical system, which was mounted a lead screw, to the correct column, and then dispense a chip into the column.
